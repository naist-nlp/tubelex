The files above are official frequency data from OpenSubtitles2018 downloaded from https://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles

Note that OpenSubtitles2018 provides two sets of Chinese data: zh_cn (PRC, implies simplified Chinese characters) and zh_tw (Taiwan, implies traditional Chinese characters), so we use zh_cn.

The original files used spaces both for padding and as separator. We have converted them
to TSV to make them easily machine readable.

Please refer to the original data and paper for your own research.
